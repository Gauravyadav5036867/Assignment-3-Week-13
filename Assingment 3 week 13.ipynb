    "PCA and feature extraction are closely related concepts in the context of dimensionality reduction. Feature extraction refers to the process of transforming raw data into a set of new features (or variables) that are more informative or representative of the underlying patterns in the data. PCA can be used as a technique for feature extraction by identifying the most important features or combinations of features in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identifying important features: PCA identifies the principal components (or eigenvectors) of the data, which represent the directions of maximum variance. Each principal component is a linear combination of the original features. By examining the weights (coefficients) of the original features in each principal component, we can identify which features contribute the most to the variance in the data. These features are considered important for representing the underlying structure of the data.\n",
    "2. Reducing dimensionality: After identifying the important features, PCA allows us to reduce the dimensionality of the data by selecting a subset of the principal components. This subset captures most of the variability in the data while reducing the number of features required to represent it. The reduced-dimensional representation can simplify subsequent analysis and modeling tasks.\n",
    "3. Feature transformation: PCA transforms the original features into a new set of features represented by the selected principal components. Each sample in the dataset is then represented by its coordinates in the reduced-dimensional feature space. These transformed features are often more informative and less redundant than the original features, making them suitable for further analysis.\n"
